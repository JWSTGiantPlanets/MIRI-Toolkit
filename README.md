# MIRI-Toolkit
Repository for MIRI visualisation and analysis tools

## Available Codes
!!!! Note that all codes here are experimental, use at your own risk !!!!

* `MIRIClean_FFT.ipynb` - Attempt to clean IFU-aligned MIRI frames by inspecting and filtering their 2D FFTs - this doesn't currently work as implemented, we're exploring other techniques.


## Known Challenges

* MIRI/MRS Wavelength solution currently insufficient, leading to striping in images associated with narrow emission lines.  The wavelengths must be shifted spaxel by spaxel to a uniform solution.
* MRS Saturation for Jupiter beyond 11 Âµm - this was expected, but workarounds are needed to access the unsaturated frames in the 4/5-group integrations.
