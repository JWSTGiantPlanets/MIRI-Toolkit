## Known Challenges

* MIRI/MRS Wavelength solution currently insufficient, leading to striping in images associated with narrow emission lines.  The wavelengths must be shifted spaxel by spaxel to a uniform solution.
* MRS Saturation for Jupiter beyond 11 Âµm - this was expected, but workarounds are needed to access the unsaturated frames in the 4/5-group integrations.
